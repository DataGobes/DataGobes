### Hey 👋 I'm Gijs

Cloud & AI engineer at Miele X, based in the Netherlands.

I build open-source tools at the intersection of AI agents and developer productivity. Most of my projects come from real pain — if I keep running into the same problem, I build something and open-source it.

**Currently shipping:**
- 🤺 **Agent Duelist** — CLI for benchmarking LLM providers on agent tasks. Speed, cost, correctness — one command.
- 🎙️ **Hackathon Engine** — AI-powered hackathon platform with a virtual MC
- 🛠️ Various tools around e-commerce, AI presentations, and cloud architecture

**Tech I work with:** TypeScript, Python, Azure, Databricks, Supabase, Vercel, Docker
